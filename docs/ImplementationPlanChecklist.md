# Forest Terrain Generator — Implementation Plan & Checklist

## Phase 0 — Project Setup & Collaboration Guardrails

Before implementation starts, align on:

- [ ] Repository scaffolding (folders, module boundaries, naming conventions)
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` collaboration rules (decision process, review cadence, ownership)
- [ ] Dependency policy (allowed libraries, version pinning, update policy, license checks)
- [ ] Build/test/tooling baseline (formatter, linter, test runner, CI entrypoints)
- [ ] Determinism policy (seed handling, tie-break conventions, float/epsilon rules)
- [ ] Data contracts first (input schema, output schema/envelope versioning, error codes)
- [ ] Environment & reproducibility standards (runtime versions, lockfiles, dev setup)
- [ ] Quality gates (definition of done for each phase, minimum tests per feature)
- [ ] Documentation baseline (where specs, ADRs, and implementation notes live)
- [ ] Risk register kickoff (known unknowns and how we de-risk early)
