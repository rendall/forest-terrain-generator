# Architecture Decision Record

This document is a living ledger of significant technical decisions made within this project. Each entry captures the context in which a decision was made, the options considered, the decision itself, and its consequences. The purpose is not to justify past choices defensively, but to preserve intent and reasoning so future contributors can understand why the system is shaped the way it is. Over time, this file forms a chronological record of trade-offs, constraints, and design direction, providing continuity as the codebase and team evolve.

Normative instructions for adding entries are defined in /docs/normative/ADRInstructions.md.
